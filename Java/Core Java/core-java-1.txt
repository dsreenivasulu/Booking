What is deadlock. Give example with solutions. Tips to avoid dead lock ?
public class DeadLockDemo { 
public void method1() {
              synchronized (String.class) { 
                System.out.println("Aquired lock on String.class object");
                    synchronized (Integer.class) { 
                       System.out.println("Aquired lock on Integer.class object"); 
                    } } } 

public void method2() {
              synchronized (Integer.class)  { 
                  System.out.println("Aquired lock on Integer.class object"); 
                        synchronized (String.class) {
                            System.out.println("Aquired lock on String.class object"); 
                            } } } }

If method1() and method2() both will be called by two or many threads , 
there is a good chance of deadlock because if thread 1 acquires lock on Sting object while executing method1() 
and thread 2 acquires lock on Integer object while executing method2() both will be waiting for each other to release lock on Integer 
and String to proceed further which will never happen.
Solution : By avoiding circular wait with no preemption.
public void method1() {
              synchronized (Integer.class) { 
                       System.out.println("Aquired lock on Integer.class object"); 
                  synchronized (String.class) { 
                        System.out.println("Aquired lock on String.class object");
                    } } } 

public void method2() {
              synchronized (Integer.class)  { 
                  System.out.println("Aquired lock on Integer.class object"); 
                        synchronized (String.class) {
                            System.out.println("Aquired lock on String.class object"); 
                            } } } }
Tips to prevent deadlocks :
Avoid Nested Locks : This is the most common reason for deadlock. Avoid locking another resource if you already hold one.
It is almost impossible to get deadlock if you are working with only one object lock.
Avoid Unnecessary Locks
Use thread join()
Lock only what is required. Like lock particular field of object instead of locking whole object if it serves your purpose.
If you need to have multiple locks in your code, make sure everyone always acquire them in the same order.
Encapsulate If you must, keep your locks local. Global locks can be really tricky.
Do as little as possible when you hold the lock.
don't hold several locks at once. If you do, always acquire the locks in the same order
