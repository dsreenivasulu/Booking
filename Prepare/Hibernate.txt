Cascade 
========
Used in Hibernate relationship mapping (Parent - Child relationship) (Owning entity - mapping/associate entity relationship) 

Person.java 

@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private Set<Address> address = new HashSet<address>();


JPA Cascade Types using in Hibernate:

CascadeType.ALL : is shorthand for all of the below cascade operations. (PERSIST+MERGE+REMOVE+REFRESH+DETACH)

CascadeType.PERSIST : means that save() or persist() operations cascade to related entities.

CascadeType.MERGE : means that related entities are merged when the owning entity is merged.

CascadeType.REMOVE : removes all related entities association with this setting when the owning entity is deleted.

CascadeType.REFRESH :  does the same thing for the refresh() operation.

CascadeType.DETACH : etaches all related entities if a “manual detach” occurs.


Hibernate Specific Cascade Types :

orphanRemoval = true :  When the child object is removed from the parent (Person )relationship 
and this object is not referenced to any other (Person)relationship then it will deleted from the DB
