What is Hadoop
Apache Hadoop is an open source software framework that can be installed on a cluster of commodity machines so the machines can communicate and work together to store and process large amounts of data in a highly distributed manner. 
Hadoop consisted of two main components: a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and a distributed computing engine that lets you implement and run programs as MapReduce jobs.

Apache Hadoop YARN

The fundamental idea of YARN is to split up the functionalities of resource management and job scheduling/monitoring into separate daemons. 
YARN will have a global ResourceManager (RM) and one ApplicationMaster (AM) per-application . An application is either a single job or a DAG of jobs.

The ResourceManager and the NodeManager form the data-computation framework. 
The ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the system. 
The NodeManager is responsible for launching containers(could either be a map or reduce task), monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the ResourceManager/Scheduler.

The ApplicationMaster is responsible negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and work with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the tasks.

Internally, The ResourceManager has two main components: Scheduler and ApplicationsManager.

The Scheduler is responsible for allocating resources to the various running applications.
It is pure scheduler it doesn't performs monitoring or tracking of status for the application. 
It performs its scheduling function based on the resource requirements of the applications.

The Scheduler has a pluggable policy which is responsible for partitioning the cluster resources among the various queues, applications etc.
CapacityScheduler and the FairScheduler would be some examples of plug-ins.

The ApplicationsManager is responsible for accepting job-submissions, negotiating the first container for executing the application specific ApplicationMaster 
and provides the service for restarting the ApplicationMaster container on failure.

MapReduce in hadoop-2.x maintains API compatibility with previous stable release (hadoop-1.x). 
This means that all MapReduce jobs should still run unchanged on top of YARN with just a recompile.

In order to scale YARN beyond few thousands nodes, YARN supports the notion of Federation via the YARN Federation feature. 
Federation allows to transparently wire together multiple yarn (sub-)clusters, and make them appear as a single massive cluster. 
This can be used to achieve larger scale, and/or to allow multiple independent clusters to be used together for very large jobs, or for tenants who have capacity across all of them.


How to get YARN logs ?
yarn logs -applicationId <application_id> 
ex : yarn logs -applicationId application_1432041223735_0001
