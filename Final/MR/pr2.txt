explain project architecture. What are source of data for your project. What is cluster size . what is CDH ?

How you store and processed images in your project ? 

1)Dump the image files using hadoop fs -put /src_image_file /dst_image_file

2)Convert images into Hadoop friendly sequence file and store them. 
Here sequence file containing key of type as image filename and value of typeas image data in HDFS. 
Input:Folder containing Images Output:Image sequence file 

2) convert sequence file image in Byte array Image IO object
 This will take sequence file as input and convert Image in Byte array to Image IO object and apply condition based patient demographichs
 Input : Image sequence file Output: Image sequence file with matched patient demographichs.
 
3)Convert Hadoop sequence file into original Images and retrive them in your local file system. 
 Input : Image sequence file with detected faces. Output : original Images with detected faces
 
How you will merge the small image sequence files ?
We have SequenceFilesUtils program which merges the files by using SequenceFile.Reader and SeuquenceFile.Writer
